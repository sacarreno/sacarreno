# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Simon, a data scientist based in Europe with a background in architecture.

After several years working as an architect, I transitioned into data science to better understand how our world is builtâ€”and how we can build it more sustainably. I'm passionate about using data to support smarter, more responsible decisions in the built environment.

Outside of work, Iâ€™m usually climbing (indoors or out), biking through new neighborhoods, or digging into the local history of the places I visit.

A few fun facts:

-I'm a big fan of mate.

-Climbing isn't just a hobby, it's a full-on obsession.
