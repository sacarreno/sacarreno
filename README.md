# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Simon, a data scientist based in Europe with a background in architecture.

After several years as an architect, I transitioned into data science to understand how our world is builtâ€”and how data can help us build it more sustainably. I work with Python, machine learning, and data visualization to solve real-world problems in the built environment and beyond.

Outside of work, I enjoy climbing, biking through new neighborhoods, and exploring the local history of the places I visit.
