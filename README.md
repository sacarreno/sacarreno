# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Simon**, a data scientist based in Europe.

Originally trained as an architect, I now use data science to explore how the world is builtâ€”and how we can build it better. I'm especially interested in the sustainability of our built environment and how data can help us make more responsible, informed decisions.

Outside of code, you'll find me climbing (indoor or outdoor), biking around new places, and diving into local history.

### Fun Facts:
- I drink mate every day.  
- Climbing is my addiction.
